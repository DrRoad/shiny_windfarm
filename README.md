# Shiny Windfarm Optimization
A Shiny App for the Optimization of wind farms with a Genetic Algorithm, which can be found here: https://windfarmga.shinyapps.io/windga_shiny/
Unfortunately, as an optimization run takes quite some time and the app is currently hosted by shinyapps.io under a public license, 
there is only 1 R-worker at hand. So only 1 optimization can be run at a time. 
If you are interested in working with it, i recommend downloading the app and running the optimizations locally.

For further information, please check the "windfarmGA" package description and examples. (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=windfarmGA/windfarmGA.pdf)
A full documentation of the genetic algorithm is given in my master thesis, which can be found at the following link:
